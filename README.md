# Simulations for the paper "Slow FAMA under Nakagami-m Fading Channels"

This repository contains the simulation codes used in the article *Slow FAMA under Nakagami-m Fading Channels*, published in the journal **Digital Signal Processing**. The codes were implemented in **MATLAB** and reproduce the results presented in the article.

## Repository Structure

- **Codes/**: Folder containing the simulation codes.
- **README.md**: This project description file.

Each code in the *Codes* folder corresponds to a figure in the article and is named according to the figure numbering.

## Requirements

To run the codes, you must have:
- **MATLAB** installed (recommended version: R2017 or higher);

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HigoTh/FAMA-Nakagami.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd FAMA-Nakagami/Codes
   ```
3. Run the code corresponding to the desired figure in MATLAB:
   ```matlab
   run('fama_fig2.m')
   ```
